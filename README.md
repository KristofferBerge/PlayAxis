# PlayAxis

Forked version of the [PlayAxis](https://github.com/mprozil/PlayAxis) custom visual. Adding buttons for selecting time-resolution enables the visual to skip values for stepping through the dataset faster. The resolution can be adjusted during playing.

>This project is just used for a demo with a dataset that has a resolution of one value per second. The visual will not adjust itself to datasets with different resolution and will just jump 60 indexes instead of one when minute is selected.
